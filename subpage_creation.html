<h1> Subpage creation </h1>

<h3> Revision </h3>
<p> We need to grab the attention of middle school students with a theme that stands out
  and is consistent throughout the subpages. In the objectives of this project, we have
  have outlined 3 major focuses regarding middle school students' wifi usage. In accordance
  to our "comic book" theme, we have renamed the categories to "How to Login"(how to login),
  "The handbook" (rules and regulation), "Tips and Tricks" (tech usage).
  We are also branching off to create another prototype alongside the working page for a more
  casual and direct look and feel to suit the audience. Rather than boring them with a list of
  things they should do, we will use comic strips to address the things they need to pay attention
  to when using the school wifi. Hopefully they will find it more interactive and engaging.
</p>

<h3> We are keeping our original flowchart. The comic strips of one topic will all be on one subpage
and the user will keep scrolling down when viewing it. </h3>
<h3> Subpage wireframe ideas </h3>
<h3> EXISTING WORKING PAGE: </h3>
<img src="Wireframe_heroes.png" style="width:500px"/>
<p> Everything is laid out on a page - all details and procedures are displayed;</br>
users scroll down to each section of the subpage and there is a "back to top" botton
</p>

<h3> NEWLY THEMED WORKING PAGE: </h3>
<p> 1. Dialogues spoken by comic characters convey the message in a tone more directed to the middle school students;
only text inside the speech box changes when the "next" button is pressed </br>

<p> 2. Comic strips relevant to one of the three corresponding subpages will be on one page </p>
<img src="Wireframe_heroes_3 (1).png" style="width:500px"/>"

<h3> Look and feel </h3>
<p> The message we hope to send across is that students need to be responsible net citizens. Rather
  than through the conventional listing of rules, which will not stand out to students' memory or
  encourage them read them on their own accord, we hope the comic strips will be a better mean to
  help us deliver the message to them. <br>

  The essential elements on our page are:
  <ul>
    <li> the AIS logo </li>
    <li> name of the site - WIFI Help </li>
    <li> navigation bar (top) for the 3 subpages so students can easily access other sections of the page </li>
    <li> navigation bar (side) for additional pages they would need e.g. the actual landing
    wifi login page or AIS moodle or gmail </li>
    <li> "next mission" button at the bottom so they know they have finished learning the information
      in a particular section </li>
</ul>
