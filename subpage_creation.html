<h1> Subpage creation </h1>

<h3> Revision </h3>
<p> We need to grab the attention of middle school students with a theme that stands out
  and is consistent throughout the subpages.

  <ul> Ideas on actionhero prototype:
    <li> Cursor: actionhero-related </li>
    <li> How to login --> Collect your gear</li>
    <li> Rules and Regulations --> The handbook </li>
    <li> Tech usage --> Tips and Tricks </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3> Subpage wireframe ideas </h3>
<img src="Wireframe_heroes.png" style="width:500px"/>
<p> 1. Everything is laid out on a page - all details and procedures are displayed;</br>
users scroll down to each section of the subpage and there is a "back to top" botton
</p>
<img src="Wireframe_heroes_2.png" style="width:500px"/>
<p> 2. Dialogues spoken by heroes convey the message in a tone more directed to the middle school students;
only text inside the speech box changes when the "next" button is pressed </br>

Both have the button "next mission" to go to the next subpage
</p>
<ul>
  <li> </li>
