<h1> Homepage creation </h1>
<h3> Hi-fi wireframes: </h3>
<img src="Homepage ver 2.jpg" style="height:300px"/>
<p> 1. Drop-down bar with video being the "Call to action" </p>
<img src="Homepage ver 4.jpg" style="height:300px"/>
<p> 2. Menu and video side by side </p>
<img src="Homepage ver 5.jpg" style="height:300px"/>
<p> 3. Intro and Menu show up first, video pops up later <p>
<img src="Homepage ver 1.jpg" style="height:300px"/>
<p> 4. Intro and huge menu in the center of the website </p>
<h3> Hi-fi wireframe of chosen design: </h3>

<h4> Feedback from chosen wireframe: </h4>
<p>
<ul>
  <li> Layout is neat but should include buttons that address most common problems e.g. how to change the login password </li>
  <li> Likes the idea of minimalistic but not sure if would appeal to middle school students </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3> Storyboard: </h3>
<img src="Wireframe_Splash_Jenny.png" width="450" height="400"><br>

<p> I went on to create a demo of the chosen storyboard on Fireworks and Dreamweaver. </p>
<h3> Homepages </h3>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="htdocs/index-FW.htm"> Firework version </a>  </li>
  <li> <a href="htdocs/index-DW.html"> Dreamweaver version </a> </li>
</ul>

<h3> The strengths of using Fireworks </h3>
<ul> Easier for images
  <li> Different layers can be hidden, locked for easy editing </li>
  <li> Prototyping: can slice different sections up as seen on a website; but if there are any
  modifications after slicing, the slicing needs to be redone </li>
  <li> Different components of the website can be saved separately </li>
  <li> Can crop/resize/edit images on the same software in the photo's respective file rather than
  going back to Fireworks if this process needs to be done when using Dreamweaver </li>
<img src="image editing.png">
  <li> Better for coordinating the layout of the whole page (spacing/alignment) </li>
<img src="Align.png">

</ul>
<h3> The strengths of using Dreamweaver </h3>
<ul> Easier for CSS/styling
  <li> Allows users to drag images directly from the list of files in the folder on the side </li>
  <li> Systematic approach to arrange the layers of AP elements: "Z-value" </li>
<img src="Z-inspector.png">
  <li> Can change CSS altogether as a class/tag/div using RULE: all titles had the same properties by
  adding the same rule to each AP div </li>
<img src="rule.png">
  <li> Semi-automatically writes codes for you </li>
  <li> Editable code on the side - Split screen mode --> makes it easier to effect changes </li>
</ul>

<h3> Summary of 2nd client meeting: </h3>
<p> We met with Ms Smith and she liked the general direction of our website's purpose/layout.
We showed her 2 sites - one as a template (AIS-themed), which could be up and running; another being
more engaging (Superhero-themed) but still needs a lot more editing.
However, she felt that it was important to gather the information we would put onto the site.
