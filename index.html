	<h3> Background brief: </h3>
	<p>  When middle school students want to know how to connect to the AIS Wifi network,
	they could first connect to "AIS Help" for a headstart on how it can be done. We aim to
	design the layout and placement of the information related to internet usage at AIS in
	the most user-friendly way possible. </p>
